              <h2>Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati...</h2>
              <p><h6>Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati – the most endearing deity to the devotees. Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati is the epitome of pride and honor to the city of Pune. Devotees from every part of India and the world come here to pray to Lord Ganesha every year. Today, Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Temple is not only one of the most highly revered places of worship in India but an institution that is actively engaged in social welfare and cultural development through Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Sarvajanik Ganpati Trust. The temple speaks of a long and glorious history. The deity of Lord Ganesha was incepted by Shri Dagdusheth Halwai and his wife Lakshmibai way back, when they lost their only son to the plague epidemic. Every year, the Ganpati festival was celebrated with deep faith and enthusiasm, not only by Dagdusheth’s family but the entire neighborhood.</h6></p>

              <h2>Shaniwar Wada</h2>
              <p><h6>The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone.The complex had an impressive lotus-shaped fountain: the Hazari Karanje (Fountain of a thousand jets). It was constructed for the pleasure of the infant Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. It was designed as a sixteen petal lotus; each petal had sixteen jets with an eighty-foot arch. It was the most complicated and intricate fountain of its time.</h6></p>
